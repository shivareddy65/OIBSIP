			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk from India. His teachings and philosophy are a reinterpretation and
				synthesis of various strands of Hindu thought, most notably classical yoga and (Advaita) Vedanta, with
				western esotericism and Universalism. He blended religion with nationalism, and applied this
				reinterpretation to various aspect's of education, faith, character building as well as social issues
				pertaining to India. His influence extended also to the west, and he was instrumental in introducing
				Yoga to the west. </p>

			<h2>Key Achievements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Vivekananda played a major role in the growing Indian nationalist sentiments in the late 19th and
					the 20th century, encouraging many Indians with his success and appeal in the West. </li>
				<li>According to Vivekananda, a country's future depends on its people, stating that "man-making is my
					mission."</li>
				<li>According to Swami Vivekananda, "faith in ourselves and faith in God- this is the secret of
					greatness". Swami Vivekananda observed the history of the world is the history of a few men who had
					faith in themselves, and it is faith which calls out divinity within.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What I Admire Most About Him</h2>
			<p>On his return to India with a small group of Western disciples in 1897, Vivekananda founded the
				Ramakrishna Mission at the monastery of Belur Math on the Ganges (Ganga) River near Calcutta (now
				Kolkata). Self-perfection and service were his ideals, and the order continued to stress them. He
				adapted and made relevant to the 20th century the very highest ideals of the Vedantic religion, and,
				although he lived only two years into that century, he left the mark of his personality on East and West
				alike. </p>
